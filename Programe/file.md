# item info

## item name

There is no item name here. You can call it anything. But I will call it **"Project1"**, because it's the firstt game I made. 

## what's this

There is a *exe* file on it, the UI of it is like the **MS DOS**. You can type commands in it. And your gole is finding the *passkey* in the forders and files. Then you can use the *passkey* to exit the game.

## how to play

You can use the commands to open *all of the forders* and *files* in the game. The commands I made include:<br>
**hello**, to say hello. You will see a sinple massege;<br>
**help**, to show all of the commands;<br>
**exit**, to exit the game, but you need the *passkey*;<br>
**goto**, to open a forder, or you can type "**goto *forder name***" to open faster;<br>
**where**, to show the current forder you are in and what files in it;<br>

## others

There is no file can be opened in it, because I **can't** make files. I'm thinking how to store them and how to open. I don't want to see another **window** when I opena file. 

Another thing is, I a green hand of C++ *(Yes, it been made by Visul C++/CLI)*, so I can't add more features in it. It's the reason of I put it on **GitHub**. 

And, if you can help me to build it, pleas contect me at <cty11072011@outlook.com>, and you also can find me at **Microsof Teams**, this is [my ID]{cid.d4bc77264710ebe2}.

## at the last

I'm student and I leant C++ for a half years. So I'm not have enough time to do that.
